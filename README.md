# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, was looking to create a system to solve the problem that a majority of people fail their driving tests on the first attempt. They wanted to crease a system that would provide practice tests and the ability to purchase packages with set driving hours that the customer could schedule with drivers for on road practice. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I captured the information for both functional and non-functional requirements well. I studied the interview notes and transferred their unique requirements into the appropriate category determining if it was a functional requirement to the system or non-functional. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe the Gantt chart within the business requirements document could have been improved if I was able to make a more detailed chart with additional information specifying teams working on each part of the development process. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When interpreting the users needs for this system I began by analyzing the interview transcript, I ended up reading through it multiple times to ensure I didn't miss any small details. I was able to pinpoint the larger milestones of the required functionality then branch off into the details of what was needed in each key part. It's important to consider all of the user's needs when designing a system to deliver a final project that functions as needed. Some parts were lacking in explanation such as security, they only mentioned they did not want to deal with it in-house so for some security aspects I did improvise based on some common standards in place by most systems. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I like to read through the requirements and write down all key components the client expects of the system then get down any details for each part. Next I think about how they will fit together and start to view it was a whole, this helps to see if any information was missing. Using diagrams can help when starting to fit the system's key functionality requirements together before beginning to code. A UML class diagram translates best into code and can help analyzing the system from the coding standpoint. I plan to continue using these strategies in the future rather than jumping straight into code as I have done in the past when beginning projects. This ensures if I do get stuck I will have a reference for what else needs to be included, preventing anything from being forgotten or left out of the system.
